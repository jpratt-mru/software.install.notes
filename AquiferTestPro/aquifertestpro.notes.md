## Type of installation

Choco msi install

## What changes will a user notice after the install?

- A Pageant shortcut is added to the Start Menu.

## Who uses it?

I dunno - just nobody in our department. Joy.

## What changes from a default installation are made?

- Nothing but the shortcut move from All Users.

## Surprises & annoyances

- This has been, historically, an ass-tastic piece of software to deal with.

## If updating this software, is there anything I should know?

- I think you don't want to try updating this...uninstall, drink heavily, and then make a new installer for the new version.

## Misc

- [UPDATE: 2017.AUG.14] Bruce and I pounded our head on this one for a while: the new license server was up, but the app wouldn't start up - when you tried, it complained about not being able to access the internet. Solution (which Bruce stumbled upon on a freakin' blog on the company's site): add the license file to C:\ProgramData\AquiferTestPro. Freakin' a.
- [UPDATE: 2017.AUG.16] Got this finally working. These guys suck - no officially supported unattended flags (though I did find some undocumented ones) and the license file crapola. Whee. But done.

## Testing

### Testing files

- None needed

### Testing method

1. Does it start? Done. (Sorry if I'm cranky, but remind me again why **I'm** stuck hacking away at this for **another** department?!?)
