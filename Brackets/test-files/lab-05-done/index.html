                <p>Once upon a time, there was a man - a mighty man - named Sporty. Raised in the barren wilds of northeastern Denver, Sporty began his dominance of all things sporty on the day that he decided to walk outside and do some jogging. </p>
                <p>From that day onward, sports became the central pivoty thing in Sporty's driven, exciting, and occasionally injurious life.</p>

            <div class="article-col right">
                <p>Sporty soon realized, despite the awesomeness that was his life, that something was missing. After much soul-searching and deep thought, Sporty had a sport-laden epiphany while scaling a mountain in some place where there were lots of mountains.</p>
