## Type of installation

Choco zip

## What changes will a user notice after the install?

- An Activate Isoplot entry is added to the Start Menu.
- If a user runs the above entry, from that point forward, any time they open Excel, it will warn them about a potentially dangerous add-on; if they wish to use Isoplot, they'll have to make sure they choose Enable from the warning dialog.

## Who uses it?

The Geo folk. Tell me why I had to make a special installer for another department again....

## What changes from a default installation are made?

- Not applicable

## Surprises & annoyances

- Meh

## If updating this software, is there anything I should know?

- No

## Misc

- This is a hack. The software is old - hell, it was old when they first got it - and it's not getting any younger. Eventually, I'm assuming this will stop working.

## Testing

### Testing files

### Testing method

1. Choose Active Isoplot from the Start Menu.
1. Run Excel, Enable the add-on, Update when prompted, then open a blank spreadsheet. You should now have a menu item in Excel under add-ons for Isoplot.
